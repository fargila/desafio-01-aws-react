# 1ยบ Project during my internship at Compass Uol

## Description
This project is a simple validation through form cadastration, so simple that it doesn't even have the backend logic for it. The user enters the site by waiting four seconds, gets a little bit of insight in the first three pages and get's the opportunity to make an account. 

## License
This project is licensed by ME, you can honestly use as much as wish, don't really care... is not like there is much to it yet.

## Acknowledgements
Thanks for my colleagues and instructors for the tips and thanks for Compass for ginving this learning opportunity.
